WhaleShark has been trying to hire more engineers for a while. We have a lot of work to do and need more quality engineers. We have a few reqs open but honestly, we have a general policy of "if we find a good engineer, let's hire them and we'll find something for them to do". We haven't run out of stuff yet. This has given me a fair bit of practice interviewing.

I've interviewed people at other places before but I have started honing my craft as of late. I was inspired by the way [frog](http://www.frogdesign.com/) interviewed me (despite not offering me the job). It was conversational, comforting even. We talked about various things I had done, occassionally drilling down into details of why or how I did something. They got me talking about my experience and got a gauge of my technical acumen without ever grilling me. This has helped change my paradigm on interviewing.

## What's in an interview?

As engineers, when we are asked to interview someone our primary directive is to assess someone's technical abilities. In fact, not just a passing assessment, but an assessment with a high degree of confidence. We need to know with as much certainty as possible this person is capable of doing the job. This is a team member, someone who will be relied on and if they can't pull their own weight it will be felt by everyone else on the team.

There are many different ways people can interview and I feel like I've been through them all. I was once asked to write up a sample DNS record on a white board when interviewing for a design/front end position because I had server admin with dns and others listed as experience on my resume. Pro tip: cull your resume to be relevant to your current position. Showing breadth of experience is great but make sure it's focused to the gig.

I have seen people do the white board thing, ask all sorts of academic questions, look at portfolios live in the interview, pair program and even give written tests. I think people sometimes get caught up in the position of power that comes with being an interviewer and
